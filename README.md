<h5>Hello!</h5>
<br/>
<p>This is PowerHack pay billing website what I have build with MERN technology.  That was a challenging project for me as I have implement custom authentication as well as JWT technology which was very interesting.

<br/> For complete this site I have used some technology and I
        also want to tell what service anyone can get from this website.</p>
<h5>Actually This is a bill pay website where someone can--</h5>
<ul>
        <li>
        Anyone can login with admin credential, admin can see all of bill list.
        </li>
        <li>
                Normal user can only see own bill list. 
        </li>
        <li>
                Anyone can register account with normal email and password.
        </li>
        <li>
                Anyone can pay bill own's bill.
        </li>
        <li>
        As well as people can update bill information also as well as also delete.
        </li>
        <li>
        As I have used mongoDB database so data will be store in mongoDB of user and bill-list.
        </li>
</ul>
